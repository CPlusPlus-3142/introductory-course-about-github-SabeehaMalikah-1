## Summary of the Intro to GitHub course

This course was a really great intro to GitHub. It touched upon many of the important GitHub features and how they can be used. My main takeaway from this course was how to commit and push, as I believe we will be using those two features throughout the course to submit our assignments!

Looking forward to a great semester.
